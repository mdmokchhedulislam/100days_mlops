The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team monitors the rolling prediction accuracy of the fraud-detection model using a Grafana dashboard. The monitoring stack is operational, with the Flask metric-emitter exposing prediction_accuracy as a gauge. Prometheus is configured to scrape this metric, and the Prometheus datasource is already pre-provisioned in Grafana. Your objective is to create a Grafana dashboard featuring a time-series panel that visualizes prediction_accuracy over time.


The Grafana UI is running on port 3000. The Grafana button opens the login page. Admin credentials: admin / grafana2026. The Prometheus datasource is already wired (pre-provisioned at startup—no datasource form to fill).

Available metrics on the Prometheus datasource include:

prediction_accuracy – The gauge for this task.
flask_http_request_total{version, endpoint, method} – Counter.
data_drift_score{column} – Per-column drift gauge.
model_inference_duration_seconds – Latency histogram.
The end state must include:

Grafana's Data sources list shows a provisioned Prometheus datasource (pre-staged).
GET /api/search?type=dash-db returns at least one user-created dashboard.
That dashboard carries at least one panel whose type is timeseries.
At least one panel across your dashboards has a Prometheus query that references prediction_accuracy.
