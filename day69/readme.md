The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team monitors per-feature data drift for the fraud-detection model using a Grafana table. This table presents one row for each feature and one column for each drift score, allowing reviewers to easily scan the entire feature set. The monitoring stack is operational; the Flask metric-emitter exposes data_drift_score as a labeled gauge (with one time-series per feature), Prometheus is actively scraping the data, and Grafana has the Prometheus datasource pre-provisioned. Your objective is to create a Grafana dashboard featuring a Table panel that displays the data_drift_score values for each column.


The Grafana UI is running on port 3000. The Grafana button opens the login page. Admin credentials: admin / grafana2026. The Prometheus datasource is pre-provisioned.

Metrics available on the Prometheus datasource:

data_drift_score{column="amount"}, data_drift_score{column="hour"}, data_drift_score{column="num_tx_past_day"} – The gauge for this task, one series per feature column.
prediction_accuracy, flask_http_request_total{version, endpoint, method}, model_inference_duration_seconds – The other signals from the shared metric-emitter.
The end state must include:

GET /api/search?type=dash-db returns at least one user-created dashboard.
At least one panel across your dashboards has type: table.
At least one of those panel's Prometheus targets references data_drift_score.
Querying data_drift_score through Grafana's datasource proxy returns non-empty Prometheus series whose labels include column – Confirming the table has per-feature rows to render.
A per-feature drift view answers 'which input shifted?' at a glance — a Table panel is the natural shape for it, one row per feature carrying that feature's latest drift score.
