The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team wants data-schema contracts on every batch that feeds the fraud-detector model—catch the malformed row upstream of training, not three hours later in production. A Great Expectations project is already initialised at /root/code/dataquality/gx/ with a pandas data source reading data/transactions.csv, an empty fraud_schema suite, and a default checkpoint wired to publish results to Data Docs on every run. Your task is to populate the suite with four expectations and run the checkpoint so Data Docs shows them green.


Open /root/code/dataquality/author_expectations.py in the VS Code editor. Four numbered TODOs call out the expectations the suite must carry:

TODO 1: ExpectTableColumnsToMatchSet with column_set=["amount", "hour", "num_tx_past_day", "is_fraud"].
TODO 2: ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween on amount with min_value=0 (no negative amounts).
TODO 3: ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween on hour with min_value=0 and max_value=23.
TODO 4: ExpectColumnValuesToBeInSet on is_fraud with value_set=[0, 1].
The helpful imports are already in place at the top of the file (import great_expectations as gx and import great_expectations.expectations as ge).

Run the script:

   python3 /root/code/dataquality/author_expectations.py

The script persists the suite to disk (gx/expectations/fraud_schema.json) and then executes the default checkpoint, which validates transactions.csv against the new suite and refreshes the Data Docs site.

Click the Data Docs button at the top of the lab (port 8081). The landing page lists one validation run under fraud_schema—click through to the run's detail page and confirm every expectation's pill reads green (Success).

The end state must include:

gx/expectations/fraud_schema.json has all four expectations by type (expect_table_columns_to_match_set, two expect_column_values_to_be_between entries – One per column — and expect_column_values_to_be_in_set).
Each expectation's kwargs match the TODO spec above.
The most recent validation JSON under gx/uncommitted/validations/ has success: true.
The Data Docs index page served on :8081 references fraud_schema.
Great Expectations treats data quality as code—expectation suites are versioned artefacts in the same repo as the model that consumes the data, run by the same CI that runs pytest. A run's result JSON is machine-readable (a downstream CI-gate lab consumes it), and Data Docs is the human-readable rendering of the same content. This lab lays the ground for both.
