The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team recently shipped a pull request (PR) titled Add speculative hashing scaffold; this PR was merged by an admin without prior review to facilitate the upcoming Wednesday release cut. Subsequently, this change has caused a lint regression, resulting in a persistent red status on the main branch. According to the team's rollback policy, reverts should not be executed from the command line, and force-pushes are strictly prohibited. Instead, reverts must be processed through a PR, following the same procedure used for the initial breakage. Your task is to utilize Gitea's Revert button on the merged PR to remove the change from the main branch, thereby restoring the CI status to green.


The Gitea UI is on port 3000 (Gitea button). Admin credentials: gitea-admin / gitea2026. The repo is at http://localhost:3000/gitea-admin/fraud-detector and a working clone is at /root/code/fraud-detector (on main). No local git commands are needed — the revert happens entirely in the Gitea UI.

The starting state: the merged PR Add speculative hashing scaffold (visible under Pull Requests → Closed) landed a regression on main, and the latest CI run on main (on the Actions tab) is red. The rollback path is Gitea's built-in revert: reverting the merged commit through a new revert branch and a second, reviewable revert PR — with its own lint + test checks — that merges the reverted state back onto main rather than force-pushing or hand-editing.

The end state must include:

The original Add speculative hashing scaffold PR is still merged (reverts do not re-open the original PR).
A second, separate PR with a title starting with Revert exists and is merged.
main's HEAD commit message contains Revert.
main's HEAD commit SHA reports combined CI status success.
The Revert button is the Gitea (and GitHub) equivalent of the incident-response pager → hotfix → revert-PR → merge playbook. It does two things the command line does not: it creates a human-reviewable PR so the rollback is audit-traceable, and it runs the full CI pipeline against the reverted state before the revert lands on main. That is the difference between fixing production and rolling production back safely.
