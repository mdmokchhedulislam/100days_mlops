The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team requires that every pull request (PR) in the fraud-detector repository logs a training run to MLflow and registers the resulting model version. However, they prefer not to include the tracking URL or an API token in plaintext within the workflow file. Gitea and a local MLflow 3.x server are currently operational, and a teammate has initiated a PR titled Register trained model on every push. Currently, the first run fails because the register job is attempting to access MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI and MLFLOW_TOKEN from the environment, but these variables are not populated. Your task is to provision these two values as repository secrets and integrate them into the workflow to ensure the run succeeds.


The Gitea UI is on port 3000 (Gitea button); admin credentials gitea-admin / gitea2026. The MLflow UI is on port 5000 (MLflow UI button). The repo is at http://localhost:3000/gitea-admin/fraud-detector and a working clone is at /root/code/fraud-detector, already checked out on branch add-registry-push. The PR is pre-opened.

The shipped .gitea/workflows/ci.yml declares a register job that runs python3 -m src.register. src/register.py reads MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI and MLFLOW_TOKEN from os.environ and exits non-zero if either is missing, so on the first run the job fails with that error. Two pieces are needed: the repository secrets MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI (value http://localhost:5000) and MLFLOW_TOKEN (any non-empty string, e.g. fraud-detector-ci-token — the lab's MLflow does not enforce auth, but the script refuses to run without the value so a missing secret surfaces as a clear failure), created under the repo's Settings → Actions → Secrets; and the workflow wiring that exports each secret into the register job's environment under the same name.

The end state must include:

GET /api/v1/repos/gitea-admin/fraud-detector/actions/secrets lists both MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI and MLFLOW_TOKEN.
The register job in the workflow references each secret via ${{ secrets.<NAME> }} inside an env: block (job-level or step-level).
The PR head commit's combined status is success.
MLflow's registered-model endpoint reports fraud-detector with at least one version.
Repository secrets are the CI version of an environment-specific config file. The YAML stays identical between dev, staging, and prod; only the secret values change. This is also the pattern you extend when you add a PyPI token, an S3 access key, or a Kubernetes kubeconfig to a workflow—never paste the value into the committed file.
