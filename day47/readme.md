The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team extended the fraud_schema suite to a second batch—data/transactions_drifted.csv, a week's worth of real production rows. The drift_check checkpoint runs the existing suite against this file and fails on its first run. Your task is to use Data Docs to diagnose which expectation failed and why, widen the offending bound in the fix-script, re-run the checkpoint, and confirm Data Docs goes green.


Open the Data Docs button (port 8081). The landing page lists two past validation runs under fraud_schema:

default – Green (against the clean transactions.csv).
drift_check – red (against the drifted file).
Click into the red drift_check run. The failing expectation's row names the column and bound; the Observed Values section shows the actual batch statistics—enough to pick a widened bound.

Open /root/code/dataquality/fix_drift.py in the VS Code editor. The four expectations are already in the script; one of them carries the bound Data Docs flagged. Widen it so the expectation admits the observed values with a little headroom. Do not delete other expectations; the fix is a widening, not a deletion.

Run the script:

   python3 /root/code/dataquality/fix_drift.py

The script re-persists the suite and re-executes the drift_check checkpoint. Expected output ends with Checkpointdrift_checkresult: success=True.

Refresh Data Docs. The most recent drift_check run is now green; every expectation pill reads Success.

The end state must include:

The drift_check checkpoint is still present in gx/checkpoints/.
gx/expectations/fraud_schema.json still has all four core expectation types (the fix is a widening, not a deletion).
The most recent validation JSON under gx/uncommitted/validations/ for checkpoint drift_check reports success: true.
The failing-validation page is the core debug surface for data-quality incidents: it tells you WHICH expectation failed, WHAT was observed, and by how much. A real team uses that same signal to decide whether the data genuinely drifted (update the rule) or whether the data is broken (fix upstream). Either way, the read-the-evidence step comes first.




"""Re-author the fraud_schema suite and re-run the drift_check checkpoint.

Startup has already populated the ``fraud_schema`` suite with the
baseline four expectations AND generated ``data/transactions_drifted.csv``.
A ``drift_check`` checkpoint runs the same suite against the drifted
file -- on first spawn it fails because a handful of rows legitimately
carry negative amounts (refunds the business now allows but that the
original guard rejects).

The fix: widen the ``amount`` lower bound so the guard matches the
updated business reality. The minimum accepted value below is still
``0`` -- change it.
