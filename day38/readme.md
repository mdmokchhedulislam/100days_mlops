The xFusionCorp Industries ML platform team runs a parallel-training bake-off on the fraud-detection model—the same estimator is trained twice, once on a single worker and once across every available CPU, and the MLflow Compare view surfaces the wall-time gap. A draft script exists at /root/code/fraud-detection/src/models/train_parallel.py, but running it currently produces near-identical wall times for the 'serial' and 'parallel' runs, and the Compare view cannot distinguish the two configurations. Your task is to correct the script so the second run genuinely runs in parallel and every MLflow run records the number of workers it actually used.


The MLflow tracking server is already running on port 5000. The MLflow UI button at the top of the lab can be opened to confirm—the dashboard loads with an empty parallel-training experiment.

The project layout under /root/code/fraud-detection/:

data/train.csv – A 5000-row synthetic binary-classification dataset (imbalanced roughly 70 / 30). Larger than the 200-row dataset used earlier in the section because the n_jobs speedup is only visible once there is enough work per tree.
src/models/train_parallel.py – The bake-off script. Data loading, MLflow experiment setup, wall-time measurement, metrics.training_time_seconds logging, and model persistence to models/model.pkl are already wired; corrections are required.
Open src/models/train_parallel.py in the VS Code editor, correct every issue that keeps the bake-off from meeting the release checklist, save, and run the script once.

The end state must include:

At least two runs exist in the parallel-training experiment on MLflow. Across the two runs, params.n_jobs takes the values 1 and -1 (no run still carries the hardcoded "all").
Every run carries metrics.training_time_seconds, and the n_jobs = -1 run is measurably faster than the n_jobs = 1 run (at least 10 %).
A pickled model at /root/code/fraud-detection/models/model.pkl.





"""Parallel training bake-off for the fraud-detection model.

Trains the same RandomForestClassifier twice — once on a single
worker, once across every available CPU — so the two configurations
can be compared side-by-side in the MLflow UI. Every run logs the
measured wall time as `metrics.training_time_seconds` and the
`n_jobs` value actually used under `params.n_jobs`.

Every non-end-state concern is correctly wired — data loading, CV
split, MLflow experiment setup, model persistence. Adjust the
`N_JOBS_VALUES` list and the `mlflow.log_param` call so the second
run actually runs in parallel and the logged `n_jobs` parameter
distinguishes the two runs in the UI.
